# Overview
This repository contains an example Python script for cryptocurrency price prediction using the Random Forest Regressor machine learning model. The code fetches historical cryptocurrency data from the cryptocompare API, preprocesses the data, trains a Random Forest Regressor model, and evaluates its performance using mean absolute error.

# Instructions:

Get an API Key:

To use this code, you need to sign up for a free API key from cryptocompare. Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' in the script with your actual API key.
Installation:

Install the required libraries by running the following command in your terminal:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Code:

Execute the crypto_prediction.py script to fetch data, train the model, and make predictions.

# Note:
This is a basic example, and the accuracy of predictions may vary.
Feel free to experiment with different models, features, and hyperparameters for better results.
Contributions and improvements are welcome.
